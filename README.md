# Interview Pairing Exercise

We've provided some source code for a small application which keeps track of the count of sales.

Your task is to deploy the application to AWS Lambda using Infrastructure as Code.

Familiarise yourself with the source code and figure out which AWS resources you will need to deploy. First focus on the getCountOfSold lambda, if you complete that we can look at the updateVehicleSales lambda.

This will be a pairing exercise so we would like you to talk us through what you are doing and ask us questions!

Looking at documentation during the exercise is completely fine and expected.

We expect you to be able to trigger the lambda and verify it's all working using the AWS Management Console (you will be guiding us as we click through the AWS Management Console in this part of the interview for access/permissions reasons).

There are no expectations to finish the exercise. The goal is to see how you work and think through the exercise.
